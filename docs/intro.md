# Emerson Bossi | Technical Writer & Documentation Specialist

I’m a bilingual (EN / PT-BR) technical writer with 3 years of education in **Computer Science** and over **11 years of experience** across **IT**, **technical support**, **content creation**, and **AI training**.

My background in **technical support** and **customer support** roles helps me understand **end-users' workflow** and their pain points. Meanwhile, my technical background and education allow me to **troubleshoot** complex issues and solve them.

By combining my **technical and customer background** with my years of **content, fiction, and technical writing** experience, I can craft **user guides, technical references, troubleshooting documentation, and industry research** for both **end-users** and **developers** alike.

Additionally, my bilingual fluency in **English** and **Brazilian Portuguese** lets me adapt and localize technical content for different audiences with varying levels of expertise.

## 📌 Featured Project

### [GitHub REST API — Technical Documentation](./github-api-doc/guides/overview/)

A Docs-as-code documentation project focused on the **GitHub REST API**, built with **Docusaurus** and validated through **real authenticated API requests**.

This is an ongoing project that will be periodically updated for improvement and additional content.

**Project Highlights**

**What this project demonstrates:**

- End-to-end API documentation structure (overview → quick start → guides → reference)

- Technical expertise via subject, structure, Docs-as-code, and Markdown command

- Authenticated requests using cURL and PowerShell

- Pagination handling and response analysis

- Error and status code mapping based on real API behavior

- Validation against official sources and live testing

- Strong emphasis on UX, scanability, and developer experience

This project represents my current technical writing skill level and my ability to document real-world APIs from exploration to final reference.

## 📝 Documentation Approach
My approach to documentation is different from the other content creation methods I use for SEO content writing or fictional writing.

I focus on awareness, clarity, structure, scope, and adequately aligning language to the target audience. The target is solving the problem for the reader rather than engaging them.
